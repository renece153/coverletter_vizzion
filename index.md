<p> Dear Vizzion Hiring Team, </p>

<p> I’m excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Vizzion. With a strong foundation in software development and hands-on experience supporting enterprise systems, I’m eager to contribute to your mission of delivering high-quality road imagery solutions. </p>

<p> During my 16-month internship at Kardium, I played a key role in the ERP go-live release, collaborating across departments to ensure data integrity and system performance. My work involved designing internal tools, optimizing SQL queries, and supporting cross-functional teams—experiences. I’m passionate about building tools that solve real-world problems and thrive in environments that value integrity, innovation, and long-term impact </p>

<p> I’m particularly drawn to Vizzion’s values of integrity, long-term impact, and continuous improvement. These resonate with my own approach to work I prioritize thoughtful design, clear communication, and sustainable solutions. </p>

<p> I’d love the opportunity to bring my energy, curiosity, and technical skills to Vizzion’s team. Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your continued success. </p>
